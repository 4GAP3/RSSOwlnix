almost fully the same as the product file for automatic builds. 

(product file opened with notepad)
except features do not have installMode="root" for the manual export.  

like 
auto build:
      <feature id="org.rssowl" installMode="root"/>
manual build:
      <feature id="org.rssowl"/>
